# Quizapp
I am developing a simple quiz app project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure of the quiz, with elements like a container for the quiz, sections for displaying questions and answers, and buttons for navigation. CSS is used to style the app, making it visually appealing with custom colors, layouts, and animations, ensuring the quiz looks great and is user-friendly across different devices. JavaScript handles the core functionality, such as loading questions, tracking the user's answers, calculating scores, and providing feedback. The app might include features like dynamic question loading, score tracking, and even a progress bar to enhance the user experience. Together, these technologies create an interactive and engaging quiz app that users can enjoy.
